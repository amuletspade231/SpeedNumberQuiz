1/26 - 1 hr

Total: 2 hr

I think this took shorter because of a several reasons.
1) This had less interconnecting parts/cases to think about
2) This was more of a quick fun project while my first project was a proof of concept of a larger passion project
3) Due to the time constraints of a deadline, I was less inclined to spend more time on expanding on my MVP
